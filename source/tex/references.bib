Key advantages brought to the end user by PMR2 include: facilities for model exchange, enhanced collaboration and a detailed change history for each model.
Availability: PMR2 is available under an open source license at http://www.cellml.org/tools/pmr/; a fully functional instance of this software can be accessed at http://models.physiomeproject.org/.
